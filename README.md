# My Project


## Project Description

This program implements a quote management system using a MongoDB database. It allows you to load authors and their quotes from JSON files, search for quotes by author or tags, and send messages to contacts via RabbitMQ.

### Key Features

- Load authors and quotes from JSON files into MongoDB.
- Search for quotes by author name or tags.
- Send emails and SMS messages to contacts using RabbitMQ.
- Use Redis for caching query results.

## Running the Program

This section outlines how to execute different components of the program.

### 1. Loading Data

To load authors and quotes from JSON files into the MongoDB database, follow these steps:

- **Ensure MongoDB is running**: Make sure your MongoDB server is up and running before executing the script.
  
- **Run the load data script**:

   python load_data.py

### Searching for Quotes

To search for quotes in the database, you can execute the search quotes script:

python search_quotes.py

### Consumers

The program includes consumer scripts to handle message processing from RabbitMQ queues. These consumers are essential for processing the SMS and email messages generated by the producer script.
To listen for SMS & email, run the following command:

python consumer_sms.py
python consumer_emails.py

After : python produce.py
